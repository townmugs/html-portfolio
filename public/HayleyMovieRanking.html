<h1>The best movies according to me,<br />
Hayley.</h1>
<h2>A top three list of movies from a top tier person</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle</h3>
<p>
    I have four incredibly consicse reasons why this movie is an incredible piece of cinemetography.<br />
1.Outlandishly choreograhped fight sequences, complete with theatrical score.<br />
2.Cameron Diaz<br />
3.Drew Barymore<br />
4.Lucy Liu.<br />
As you can may guess these are four completely uncontestable reasons for this being an outstanding Movie
 </p>
 <h3>Scott Pilgrim VS. The World</h3>
 <p>
Ramona Flowers,Ramona Flowers, Ramona Flowers. <br />
The latter statement could stand alone, however for my honorable mentions - Every other part played by a Woman, makes this movie a masterpiece as well.
 </p>
 <h3>Twilight</h3>
 <p>This may come as a surprise, but my reasons are as follows - Alice Cullen, Rosalie Cullen, and Charlie's Mustache.</p>

 <p>In Conclusion,<br />
Cast Hot actors in your film to succeed. <br />
